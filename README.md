# March Madness Analysis

**Files**
* **March Madness** - Enterprise Guide file that was used to do all the data preprocessing. The 3 sas code files were all written in here.
* **Extract Seeds** - pulled the tournament seeds and regions and put them into separate columns. Used this table to join instead the tournament seed file provided 
* **Remove Duplicates** - removed observations that repeated themselves while merging, often due to a school firing and hiring a new coach before the NCAA tournament was officially over. 
* **Modeling** - created the train and test and created a logistic regression model using proc logistic 
* **MM Report** - SAS Visual Analytics Dashboard resources. Used to create charts and graphs
